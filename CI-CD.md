## What is DevOps? (Learning Perspective) 

DevOps is a culture + set of practices that bridges Development and Operations to deliver software:
- Faster
- More reliably
- With automation and monitoring

Core Goal
👉 Reduce time from code commit to production deployment
👉 Increase stability and quality

DevOps focuses on:
- Automation
- Collaboration
- Continuous feedback

## Problems Before DevOps (Why DevOps Exists)

Traditional model:
- Dev → Code
- Ops → Deploy & Maintain

Issues:
- Slow releases
- Blame culture
- Manual deployments
- Environment mismatch
- Frequent production failures

👉 DevOps solves these by automation + shared ownership.

## DevOps Lifecycle (VERY IMPORTANT)

```
Note: This lifecycle is asked directly in interviews.
```

- Plan – Requirements, Jira, Agile
- Code – Git, GitHub
- Build – Maven, Gradle
- Test – Automated testing
- Release – Versioning
- Deploy – Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- Operate – Servers, containers
- Monitor – Logs, alerts
- Continuous feedback loop

## CI/CD Explained (Core Concept)

CI – Continuous Integration

- Developers frequently push code
- Automated build & test runs
- Early bug detection

CD – Continuous Delivery / Deployment

- Automated deployment to environments
- Faster releases
- Less manual error

👉 CI/CD is heart of DevOps.

## CI/CD Tools You Used (Skills Mapping)

Jenkins
- Open-source automation server
- Pipeline as code
- Widely used in enterprises

GitHub Actions
- Native CI/CD in GitHub
- Event-driven pipelines
- YAML-based workflows

👉 You have practical exposure — this is strong.

## Real-World CI/CD Flow (Interview Ready)

- Developer pushes code to GitHub
- CI pipeline triggers
- Code is built and tested
- Artifacts created
- Deployment pipeline runs
- Application deployed to server/cloud
- Monitoring & rollback if failure

## Common Interview Questions

Q1: What is DevOps?\
A: DevOps is a culture that combines development and operations to automate and improve software delivery.

Q2: What is CI/CD?\
A: CI/CD automates code integration, testing, and deployment to ensure faster and reliable releases.

Q3: Jenkins vs GitHub Actions?\
- Jenkins: External tool, more control
- GitHub Actions: GitHub-native, simpler setup

Q4: Why automation is important in DevOps?\
A: Reduces human error, speeds delivery, improves consistency.

🔑 Key Takeaways (Revision Ready)

- DevOps = Culture + Automation
- CI/CD = Core of DevOps
- Automation replaces manual deployment
