🐚 Shell Scripting – Interview Notes & Project-Based Q&A

This repository contains commonly asked Shell Scripting interview questions, basic Linux commands, and real DevOps project-based explanations.

📌 Commonly Used Linux Shell Commands (Basics Only)

Focused on daily usage and interview basics (not advanced/debug-only commands)

Command	Description
ls	List files and directories
cp	Copy files or directories
mv	Move or rename files
mkdir	Create directories
touch	Create empty files
vim	Edit files
grep	Search text patterns
df -h	Disk usage (human readable)
free -m	Memory usage in MB
nproc	Number of CPU cores
📌 List All Running Processes
ps -ef

Print Only Process IDs (PID)
ps -ef | awk '{print $2}'

📌 Print Only Errors From a Remote Log File
curl <remote-log-file-url> | grep -i error

📌 Shell Script: Print Numbers Divisible by 3 and 5 but NOT 15
Logic:

Loop from 1 to 100

Divisible by 3

Divisible by 5

NOT divisible by 15

📌 Count Number of Letter "S" in mississippi
echo "mississippi" | grep -o "s" | wc -l

📌 How to Debug a Shell Script
set -x


✔ Enables debug mode
✔ Prints each command before execution

📌 What is Crontab in Linux?

crontab is used to schedule commands or scripts to run automatically at a specified time.

Example: Run script daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /home/ubuntu/script.sh

📌 Open a File in Read-Only Mode
vim -R test.txt

📌 Difference Between Soft Link and Hard Link
🔹 Hard Link

Points directly to the inode

Survives even if original file is deleted

Cannot span file systems

Cannot link directories

ln file1 file2

🔹 Soft Link (Symbolic Link)

Acts like a shortcut

Breaks if original file is deleted

Can span file systems

Commonly used for aliases (e.g., python -> python3)

ln -s file1 file2

📌 Difference Between break and continue
Statement	Behavior
break	Stops the loop completely
continue	Skips current iteration and moves to next
📌 Disadvantages of Shell Scripting

Each command spawns a new process

Error handling is limited

Weak data structures

Slower execution compared to compiled languages

Difficult to maintain large codebases

📌 Types of Loops in Shell Script
Loop	Use Case
for	Fixed number of iterations
while	Condition-based loop
until	Runs until condition becomes true
📌 Is Bash Dynamically or Statically Typed?

✔ Dynamically Typed

x=5
x="string"


No type declaration required (unlike Go, Java).

📌 Networking Troubleshooting Utilities
🔹 traceroute

Shows hops from source to destination

Requires sudo

sudo traceroute google.com

🔹 tracepath

Similar to traceroute

No sudo required

tracepath google.com

📌 Sort Names in a File
sort names.txt

📌 Managing Huge Log Files

✔ Use logrotate

Features:

Rotate logs

Compress old logs

Delete logs after a defined period

🚀 Shell Scripting – Project-Based Interview Questions
1️⃣ What shell scripting projects have you worked on?

Answer:

AWS resource usage monitoring using AWS CLI (S3, EC2, IAM, Lambda)

GitHub repository audit script to list users with read-only access

2️⃣ How did you automate AWS resource monitoring?

Answer:

Used AWS CLI inside shell scripts

Collected resource details

Automated execution using cron

Logged output for auditing

3️⃣ What is cron and how did you use it?

Answer:

Cron is a Linux scheduler for automating tasks.

0 2 * * * /home/ubuntu/aws_usage.sh >> /home/ubuntu/aws_cron.log 2>&1

4️⃣ Why use >> and 2>&1?

>> → Appends logs

2>&1 → Redirects errors to log file

✔ Helps debug cron jobs

5️⃣ What is set -x?

Enables debug mode by printing commands before execution.

6️⃣ How did you handle AWS authentication?

Used aws configure

Relied on IAM roles / credentials

Followed AWS security best practices

7️⃣ What is jq and why was it required?

Command-line JSON parser

Used to extract fields from AWS CLI and GitHub API responses

8️⃣ How did GitHub read-only access script work?

Used curl to call GitHub API

Filtered users with pull permission using jq

9️⃣ How did you secure GitHub tokens?

Stored tokens as environment variables

Avoided hardcoding credentials

🔟 Error Handling in Scripts

Checked empty outputs

Validated input arguments

Printed user-friendly messages

1️⃣1️⃣ Possible Improvements

Argument validation

Timestamped logs

Slack/Email alerts

Modular functions

Dockerization

1️⃣2️⃣ Why is Shell Scripting Important in DevOps?

Automation

CI/CD pipelines

System administration

Cloud operations

Tool integration

🎯 Interview Tip (IMPORTANT)

Question:

Do you have hands-on experience?

Answer:
✅ Yes, I implemented shell automation projects involving AWS resource tracking, cron scheduling, logging, GitHub API integration, and permission auditing.
